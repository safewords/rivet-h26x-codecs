#!/bin/bash
# wasm.sh — decode inside wasm and check the bytes.
#
# `cargo test` cannot run on wasm32-unknown-unknown: no test harness, no
# filesystem, no clock. So CI can prove the crate *compiles* for wasm and
# nothing more, and a decoder that compiles and aborts on its first picture
# passes every check anyone runs and fails in front of a user. This crate did
# exactly that until the profiling clock reads were guarded — HEVC panicked on
# its first NAL because `Instant::now()` is not implemented there, while H.264
# worked by happening never to take a reading.
#
# Two questions, and this answers both:
#
#   1. Does wasm decode correctly at all? The three vendored streams are
#      decoded inside the module and checked against `tests/decode.rs` — frame
#      counts and output hashes both. Those expectations are read out of that
#      file rather than copied here, because a copy drifts and the stale one is
#      the one somebody trusts; they were anchored frame-by-frame against
#      the reference decoders, so passing here means what it means natively.
#
#   2. Does the simd128 tier still decode to the same bytes as the scalar one?
#      With FIXTURES set, every fixture is decoded by both builds and the
#      results compared. That is the wasm half of what `verify.sh` does for the
#      x86 rungs, and it is the check the kernels have to keep passing.
#
#   FIXTURES=dir  also sweep every stream named in dir/golden.txt
#   ENC_CLIPS=dir also encode every src_*_420.yuv there (the 8-bit gate
#                 corpus) in the encode round trip
#
#   3. Do the encode-side kernels (distortion, H.265 forward transforms and
#      quantiser) have the same property, and does an encode inside wasm
#      produce the bytes the scalar build produces? See the encode section.
#
# Exits nonzero on the first disagreement.
