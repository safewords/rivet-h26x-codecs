//! The deblocking filter (H.264 clause 8.7), run over the whole picture
//! once every slice is decoded: boundary strength per edge segment, then
//! the luma and chroma edge filters, macroblock by macroblock in raster
//! order — vertical edges first, then horizontal, luma then chroma.

//! Where the time in here goes, on cabac3 at the AVX2 rung. Two instruments,
//! because they disagree and the disagreement is the useful part.
//!
//! **Free-in-turn** — each part made free and the whole decode remeasured,
//! same binary with the parts selected by environment variable so the code
//! layout is identical on every side, randomised order within each round, and
//! a same-rung control row reading 1.000 [0.993, 1.014]. As a share of
//! whole-decode time:
//!
//! | | cabac3 | bbb_720p_cabac |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the per-macroblock walk, thresholds, filter-call entry | ~3.6% | |
//! | macroblock-edge strengths (of which motion ~1.5%) | ~2.9% | |
//! | internal-edge strengths | ~0% | |
//! | the filter kernels | 4.4% | 4.6% |
//! | dispatch: `tc4` on the stack, indirect call | 0.7% | 0.1% |
//! | **the stage** | **11.0%** | **11.4%** |
//!
//! **An `rdtsc` window** around `deblock_mb_rows` and around the derivation
//! inside it, `lfence`d and accumulated without a lock prefix: the filter is
//! 11.8% of decode and the derivation **34.6% of the filter**, or 4.1% of
//! decode. The two instruments agree on the filter's total share — 11.0%
//! against 11.8% — and disagree on the derivation's, 2.9% against 4.1%.
//!
//! Neither is wrong. A window charges its region for the stalls the region
//! *starts*, and the derivation starts the one that matters: the first touch
//! of `frame.motion`. Free-in-turn charges only what is actually recovered by
//! removing the work, which is less whenever the stall was overlapping
//! something else. **For sizing an optimisation, the free-in-turn number is
//! the one that predicts what you get**; the window is an upper bound on it.
//!
//! What that leaves, in the order anyone should reconsider it:
//!
//! - **The per-macroblock walk is the largest row and has no hot spot.**
//! - **The macroblock-edge motion is ~1.5%**, and a digest settling 52% of
//!   those edges is built, green and parked on `perf/deblock-motion-key` at
//!   0.3% end to end. Read it rather than rederiving it.
//! - **`ThrTable` is 0.15% of decode** — 410 cycles a build, one build per
//!   macroblock row, 32,535 of them. Measured, replacing an estimate of
//!   ~1.7% of the filter with 1.3%. Holding the table across calls is a
//!   contained change and buys a sixth of a percent.
//! - **The internal edges are free.** Skipping their derivation entirely did
//!   not measure above the floor: the mask-driven path with `nz_mask`,
//!   `part_edges` and the run-caching in `edge_motion` has finished the job.
//! - **The neighbour `MbInfo` loads are free**, which is the one that looks
//!   wrong — the row above is a different cache line per macroblock. Reading
//!   the current macroblock's info in the neighbour's place, for identical
//!   instruction count and perfect locality, changed the time by 0.0%. A
//!   cache miss you can argue for is not a cache miss you have measured.
//! - **The dispatch is 0.1-0.7%**, so a multi-edge entry point collapsing the
//!   six-to-eight calls per macroblock is buying that at most, against a
//!   `H264Dsp` signature change across four architecture files.
//!
//! Which is to say: this stage has been examined, and what is left in it is
//! diffuse. Sizing anything here at more than about a percent needs a new
//! measurement, not a new estimate.
