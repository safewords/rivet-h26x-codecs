//! Frame-level threading: a worker pool that decodes whole pictures in
//! parallel, and the row-progress handshake that lets a picture read from a
//! reference that is still being decoded — libavcodec's frame-threading
//! model. Every picture is decoded top to bottom; it publishes how many
//! luma rows are final (deblocked, SAO'd, edge-extended) as it goes, and a
//! later picture that needs samples from it waits for exactly the rows its
//! motion vector reaches. Dependencies only ever point at pictures earlier
//! in decode order, which started earlier, so nothing can wait in a cycle.
