//! The coded picture buffer, simulated — the only instrument that can see
//! whether a stream conforms to the buffer it declares.
//!
//! # Why this is not SELF, not CROSS, and not quality
//!
//! The gate's three properties are conformance (SELF and CROSS: the stream
//! means what the encoder thinks, exactly, checked against a decoder),
//! quality (PSNR: a measurement, reported), and control (`encode::rc`: did
//! the encoder achieve what it was handed, with no ground truth at all).
//!
//! Buffer conformance is a fourth position and belongs to none of them. It
//! **has a right answer** — given the declared parameters and the coded
//! access unit sizes, whether the buffer underflows is determined integer
//! arithmetic, not a judgement — which makes it conformance by nature
//! rather than control. But **neither of our conformance instruments can
//! see it**:
//!
//! - Our own decoder cannot. Until this change both parsers read the HRD
//!   fields purely to stay bit-aligned and discarded them, and that was not
//!   an oversight: **a decoder is not required to check the HRD at all.**
//!   It is a constraint on the *encoder*, verified by a separate
//!   conformance checker.
//! - libavcodec cannot either. It decodes a stream that overflows its
//!   declared buffer exactly as happily as one that does not, so CROSS is
//!   structurally blind.
//!
//! So the check has to be written, and the one rule that keeps it honest is
//! that it is **driven by the stream, never by the encoder**: every number
//! below comes out of the emitted bytes through the production parsers. An
//! encoder that told this module what buffer it had intended would be
//! marking its own homework, and would agree with itself no matter what it
//! wrote. Same discipline as the SAO check comparing against the filter's
//! actual output rather than its own prediction.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! The leaky bucket of Annex C, in the one configuration this encoder
//! writes — NAL HRD, a single coded picture buffer, constant bit rate,
//! fixed picture rate, no sub-picture parameters:
//!
//! - Bits arrive continuously at `BitRate`.
//! - Access unit `n` is **removed whole** at `t_r(n)`, which for a fixed
//!   picture rate is `t_r(0) + n / fps`, with `t_r(0)` the
//!   `initial_cpb_removal_delay` the buffering period SEI carries.
//! - **Underflow** is the failure: at `t_r(n)` the buffer holds fewer bits
//!   than the access unit needs. The stream promised a decoder it could
//!   start decoding after `t_r(0)` and keep up, and it cannot.
//! - **Overflow** matters only under `cbr_flag`, where the arrival never
//!   pauses: bits that would push the buffer past `CpbSize` have nowhere to
//!   go. With `cbr_flag` clear the arrival simply stops and a full buffer
//!   is not an error, which is why [`Report::overflow`] is only populated
//!   for the constant-rate case.
//!
//! Everything is integer: bits and 90 kHz ticks, no floating point
//! anywhere, so the verdict is reproducible rather than nearly so. A
//! frame rate that is not a whole number of 90 kHz ticks — 29.97 in
//! H.264's field clock is 1501.5 of them — is kept as the exact fraction
//! (`Schedule::tick_den`), and the removal times are counted in the
//! fraction's own units, so a long stream does not drift by the rounding.
