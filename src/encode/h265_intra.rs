//! Intra mode decision and reconstruction for H.265.
//!
//! This is the *deciding* half of coding a CTU: which prediction modes,
//! what the quantised coefficients are, and what the reconstruction looks
//! like. Turning that into bits belongs to the CABAC coding-tree writer,
//! and the seam between the two is [`CuDecision`] — data, not a shared
//! file, so the decision cannot drift from the writer that serialises it.
//!
//! The two rules of [`super::h264_intra`] hold here unchanged:
//!
//! **The prediction is the decoder's own.** `hevc::intra::predict` is
//! conformance-proven against the JCT-VC suites and runs here as-is,
//! reading its reference samples out of the reconstruction plane with the
//! same availability, substitution, smoothing and boundary-filter rules it
//! applies when decoding. An encoder that predicted even slightly
//! differently would desync, and the desync would surface as drift in a
//! SELF check far from the cause.
//!
//! **So is the reconstruction.** After quantising, the levels go back
//! through the decoder's own `scale_coefficients` and inverse transforms
//! (`HevcDsp::{idct, idst4}`, `add_residual`), so the reconstruction this
//! block's neighbours predict from is what a decoder will hold — by
//! construction, not by hope.
//!
//! Candidates are scored by SATD on the prediction, for the reason the
//! H.264 side gives: it prices a residual the way the transform that will
//! code it does. All 35 modes are searched exhaustively — no MPM-style
//! shortlist yet; at these block counts the full search is cheap and it
//! removes a heuristic from the path while the module is young.
//!
//! # Simplifications — read before extending
//!
//! This is a first cut with a deliberately fixed geometry, and every one of
//! these is a simplification to be lifted, not a design position:
//!
//! - **The coding quadtree is the caller's choice.** `IntraPicture::code_ctu`
//!   codes a CTB as one unit; `IntraPicture::code_ctu_tree` splits it by
//!   rate-distortion cost down to the 8x8 minimum coding block, where
//!   `PART_NxN` competes with `PART_2Nx2N`. Pictures must be whole
//!   multiples of the CTB.
//! - **Partitioning per size, one transform-split level.** `log2_cu` 4 or
//!   5 codes `PART_2Nx2N`, and when [`IntraPicture::split_depth`] allows the
//!   decision tries one level of transform split — four quarter-size TUs
//!   against the single CU-sized one, chroma splitting alongside as the
//!   decoder's `transform_tree` dictates. The picture loops set
//!   `split_depth` 1, and the writer spells both shapes. The 4x4 DST is
//!   reached from production geometry by the coding quadtree's 8x8 units,
//!   as `PART_NxN` (four 4x4 luma TUs, with 4:2:0 / 4:2:2 chroma once at
//!   the parent — `transform_unit`'s `blk_idx == 3` case); an 8x8
//!   `PART_2Nx2N` unit does not split its transform.
//! - **All four chroma formats** ([`IntraPicture::new_with_chroma`];
//!   plain `new` stays 4:2:0). Monochrome simply omits every chroma
//!   element, mirroring the reader's `chroma_array_type == 0` gates.
//!   4:2:0 carries one chroma TU per component at half the luma TU size;
//!   4:2:2 the stacked pair of half-size squares `transform_unit` walks
//!   (`yct = yc + t * nc`), each square with its own cbf, the derived
//!   mode passing through the Table 8-3 remap and the chroma QP through
//!   the plain clamp rather than Table 8-10; 4:4:4 one chroma TU at the
//!   luma TU's own size and position, with the reference-smoothing
//!   filter on for chroma too (`intra_predict_block`'s
//!   `c_idx == 0 || cat == 3`). `PART_NxN` at the 8x8 minimum coding
//!   block (`code_cu_nxn_intra`) carries, at 4:4:4, four chroma modes
//!   and a 4x4 chroma block inside every luma block; the coding
//!   quadtree (`max_cu_depth`) is what reaches it from production
//!   geometry, where it competes with the 8x8 `PART_2Nx2N` unit by
//!   rate-distortion cost.
//! - **One slice, one tile, raster CTU order.** Availability reduces to
//!   picture geometry plus z-scan order, mirrored from the decoder.
//! - **Flat scaling lists, no transform skip, no RDPCM, no rotation** —
//!   matching what `write_sps` / `write_pps` currently emit (no scaling
//!   lists, `transform_skip_enabled_flag` 0, no range extensions).
//! - **One quantiser per CU, the caller's** — `IntraCtx::qp`, which the
//!   picture loop varies per CTB under adaptive quantisation; the
//!   decision records the `QpY` a decoder will hold in
//!   [`CuDecision::qp_y`] and never chooses it.
//! - **Lossless is a whole-picture switch** (`IntraCtx::bypass`): every CU
//!   gets `cu_transquant_bypass_flag`, the residual is carried raw, and the
//!   PPS must set `transquant_bypass_enabled_flag` to match.
//!
//! Deblocking and SAO are downstream concerns: H.265 intra prediction reads
//! the *pre-filter* reconstruction, which is exactly what this module
//! holds, so the in-loop filters can be applied behind it later without
//! touching anything here.

///   intra CU scan vertically for modes 6..=14 and horizontally for
///   22..=30, diagonally otherwise), so the writer derives `scanIdx` from
///   the modes stored here rather than this side pre-scanning.
/// - **No QP delta.** The unit's quantiser is `qp_y`; the `cu_qp_delta`
///   that carries it is the encoder's quantiser chain's to derive.
/// - **No `transform_skip_flag` / RDPCM / rotation fields.** Never emitted
///   under the current SPS/PPS; add them beside `bypass` when they are.
/// - **No `split_cu_flag`.** A decision is one coding unit; where it sits
///   in the coding quadtree travels beside it (`TreeCu`), and the tree walk
///   derives every `split_cu_flag` from the placements. Inside the unit the
///   writer derives `split_transform_flag` from `split_tu`, `split_child`
///   and `nxn` against the SPS it wrote.

/// regressed against six that improved, PSNR −0.039 dB on average. The
/// change is not in the tree; this note is, so the next person does not
/// spend the day rediscovering it.
///
/// What the measurement showed, which is the useful part:
///
/// - The luma numbers here are very nearly right. At QP 26 the true costs
///   are 1.92 / 2.92 / 6.09 against this table's 2 / 3 / 6, and the
///   difference that actually drives the decision — escape minus
///   most-probable — is 4.17 against 4.
/// - **The chroma numbers are not.** `ChromaExplicit` costs 3.69 bits at
///   QP 26 and 5.64 at QP 40, against 3 here: understated by 88% at high
///   QP, where these cells regressed. `ChromaDerived` is 0.53 and 0.12
///   against 1.
/// - So the correction is real, and pricing it correctly still lost.
///
/// Two explanations were tested and BOTH are wrong, which is worth more
/// than the guesses would have been:
///
/// - **Not the Lagrangian.** Doubling it made things worse again (size
///   +1.36%), so the imbalance is not a uniform scale error.
/// - **Not the residual charge beside it, though that WAS wrong.** The
///   obvious suspect was the flat three-bins-per-level residual charge
///   these costs were compared against. Sweeping its scale to 6 and 9
///   recovered nothing (13 / 15 / 17 cells regressing at 3 / 6 / 9) — but
///   a scale sweep only ever tested the scale. Its *shape* was indeed
///   wrong, and replacing it with a real count of `write_ctu_intra` was a
///   large win on its own: 35 cells better against 4 worse, size -0.90%,
///   PSNR +0.019 dB. It still did not rescue the counted mode rate, which
///   was then retried on top of it and lost again, 10 cells worse against
///   2. So the residual term was a real bug and a separate one.
///
/// - **Not the static probabilities either.** That was the last standing
///   explanation and it has now been tested. An adapted context array was
///   carried through the decision pass and advanced CTU by CTU through
///   the real writer, so each candidate was priced against the model its
///   CTU would actually be coded with — exact rather than approximate,
///   because the decision pass and the serialise pass walk CTUs in the
///   same raster order. It helped the mode rate a great deal and still
///   was not enough: +0.16% BD-rate against this table, down from a clear
///   loss under static probabilities, but a loss.
///
/// FOUR explanations tested, four out. The conclusion is structural
/// rather than a missing term: **this hand-tuned table is genuinely
/// competitive with a correct price, and correctness in the rate alone
/// does not beat it.** It is the fitted-constant effect in its purest
/// form — the table was never measured against the rate it stood for, so
/// it absorbed whatever else was off in the same comparison, and what it
/// absorbs is worth about as much as the error it introduces. Something
/// other than rate accuracy is carrying the difference, and until that is
/// identified there is nothing to fix here.
///
/// Worth knowing for anyone tempted by the adapted model elsewhere: it
/// was measured on `cu_bits` at the same time, where every price is also
/// taken at the slice's initial probabilities, and it moved 24 cells for
/// **-0.03% BD-rate**. So the "initial rather than adapted" limit those
/// docblocks name is real and, on this corpus, worth almost nothing. The
/// plumbing was reverted; the measurement is the result.
///
/// This table stays, not because it is right but because it is measurably
/// the best thing anyone has produced for the job.

///
/// Textbook RDOQ walks coefficients one at a time, pricing "code this
/// level, or one less, or zero" against an incremental rate model derived
/// from the CABAC contexts. That model is a reimplementation of
/// `write_residual` — significance maps, coefficient groups, the
/// greater-1 and greater-2 flags, Golomb-Rice remainders, and context
/// derivation from neighbouring groups. It is the largest and most
/// intricate writer in the crate, and a copy of it on the encode side is
/// exactly the drift this project has spent its time deleting. It is also
/// the copy that would be hardest to keep honest, because nothing but a
/// desync would ever reveal it as wrong.
///
/// So the rate here is never modelled: each candidate is a complete level
/// array, handed to `write_residual` through a counting encoder, and what
/// comes back is what that block will really cost. The distortion is
/// measured the same way — every candidate is reconstructed through the
/// decoder's own scaling and inverse transform and compared to the source
/// by true SSD. Approximating distortion in the transform domain while
/// counting rate exactly would be an odd asymmetry, and Parseval only
/// holds up to the rounding this path deliberately keeps.
///
/// The cost of that honesty is granularity: this is **not per-coefficient
/// RDOQ**. It chooses among a bounded set of complete level sets rather
/// than optimising every coefficient independently, which is a smaller
/// search for a bounded price — `CANDIDATES` residual encodes per
/// transform block, not one per coefficient per level.
///
/// # The candidates
///
/// Trailing-coefficient trims, in scan order. Dropping the last
/// significant coefficient saves more than its own level: the
/// last-position syntax moves closer to the origin and every significance
/// flag beyond the new last stops being coded at all, which is why this is
