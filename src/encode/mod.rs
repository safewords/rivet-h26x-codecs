//! The encoding side: H.264 and H.265 bitstreams produced from raw pictures.
//!
//! The decoders in this crate are bit-exact against the JVT and JCT-VC
//! conformance suites, and that shapes how the encoders are built and how they
//! are verified. An encoder has no conformance suite — there is no set of
//! reference bitstreams it must reproduce, because a standard constrains what
//! a *decoder* must do with a bitstream and leaves an encoder free to choose
//! any legal one. So "is the encoder correct" is not a question with a golden
//! answer, and the temptation is to answer a weaker question instead and call
//! it verified.
//!
//! # What correctness means here
//!
//! Three properties, in the order they are worth checking. Each is exact —
//! none is a measurement, and none has a noise floor:
//!
//! 1. **The bitstream decodes to what the encoder thinks it encoded.** The
//!    encoder reconstructs every picture as it goes, because prediction
//!    depends on reconstructed samples; running the decoder over its output
//!    must produce byte-identical pictures to those reconstructions. A
//!    mismatch is a desync — the encoder and decoder disagreed about state —
//!    and it is always a bug, never a quality question. This is the property
//!    that catches the largest class of encoder faults, and it needs no
//!    reference data at all.
//!
//! 2. **Another decoder agrees.** The ITU-T reference decoder (JM for H.264,
//!    HM for H.265) decoding our output must produce the same pictures our
//!    decoder does. Property 1 is self-consistent and
//!    would pass happily if both sides shared a misreading of the standard;
//!    this is what makes the bitstream *legal* rather than merely
//!    self-compatible. It is also the property that matters commercially,
//!    since the output has to play elsewhere.
//!
//! 3. **The reconstruction is close to the source**, which is the only one of
//!    the three that is a quality question rather than a correctness one, and
//!    the only one with a knob attached. Reported as PSNR against the input,
//!    at a stated bitrate. Lossless mode makes it exact and therefore checkable
//!    like the other two.
//!
//! `tools/verify_encode.sh` gates 1 and 2 and reports 3. It also gates a
//! fourth exact property the first three structurally cannot see, because
//! both decoders read Annex-B: **one parameter set of each kind per
//! stream**, byte for byte. A re-sent PPS replaces the old one in Annex-B
//! and passes SELF and CROSS; in an MP4 `avc1` box the sets live out of
//! band, so a PPS that changed between the I and P pictures decodes the
//! pictures under the other one to garbage — which is how rivet's first
//! H.264 file failed with the whole gate green. See `tools/param_sets.py`.
//!
//! One more exact property applies only to what the samples cannot show:
//! **the stream says what colour it is**. A [`ColourDescription`], a
//! chroma siting or the HDR10 static metadata change no sample, so SELF
//! and CROSS pass whether the VUI and SEIs carry them or not, and the
//! crate's own parsers are the writers' inverses — a shared misreading of
//! E.1.1 round-trips cleanly. The gate therefore asks a *third* reader:
//! `tools/vui_probe.py` has MediaInfo name every field (and reads the HDR
//! SEIs back exactly, through HM for H.265), and a `--color` row
//! is green only when the names are exactly the codes the encoder was
//! handed (`VUI-FAIL` otherwise). A player showing BT.2020 PQ as washed-out
//! BT.709 is the failure that row exists to prevent.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Deliberately the mirror of the decoders: an `H264Encoder` takes pictures
//! in and hands NAL units out, the way [`crate::h264::H264Decoder`] takes NAL
//! units in and hands pictures out. The same pixel kernels serve
//! both directions — the encoder's reconstruction loop *is* a decoder, and
//! reusing the conformance-proven inverse transform, prediction and
//! deblocking there is what makes property 1 achievable rather than
//! aspirational.
//!
//! The encode-only kernels — forward transforms, quantisation, and the
//! distortion metrics that motion search lives in — sit behind the same
//! runtime-dispatched table as the decode kernels, so the instruction-set
//! ladder covers them without a second mechanism.
