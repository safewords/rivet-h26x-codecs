//! Picture-level rate control: choosing a quantiser per picture to meet a
//! bitrate target. **Shared by both codecs.**
//!
//! It began as H.265's and moved here whole when H.264 wanted one, which is
//! not what anybody expected — the guess going in was that the budget and
//! the damping would be common and the quantiser-to-bits relationship would
//! not. It is the other way round, and emphatically: H.264 and H.265 define
//! the quantiser *identically*, as a step size that doubles every six, and
//! both decoders in this crate index their dequantisation tables by
//! `qp % 6` and shift by `qp / 6` (`h264::transform`, `hevc::residual`). The
//! one law this module steers by is therefore the most shared thing in it,
//! not the least.
//!
//! What is genuinely per-codec turned out to be only wiring, and little of
//! it: mapping that encoder's picture kind to [`PicKind`], and calling
//! [`RateController::pick_qp`] and [`RateController::account_stuffed`] in
//! its own loop. Both encoders already carried a per-picture quantiser against a
//! fixed one in the parameter set — `slice_qp_delta` in both — so neither
//! needed new syntax to vary it.
//!
//! The one thing sharing *did* surface: H.264's constant-quantiser path
//! already believed B pictures could afford to be worse, coding them at
//! `qp + 2`. This module had no such belief and lumped them in with P. That
//! was a gap in the H.265 controller rather than a difference between the
//! codecs — H.265 has B pictures too — so [`B_WEIGHT`] fixes it for both.
//!
//! # Three kinds of property, and why this one is different
//!
//! Everything this encoder produces has been checkable against something.
//! Rate control is the first thing that is not, and it is worth naming the
//! three kinds so the difference is visible rather than felt:
//!
//! - **Conformance** — SELF and CROSS. The stream means what the encoder
//!   thinks it means: our decoder reproduces the encoder's own
//!   reconstruction byte for byte, and the reference decoder (JM / HM)
//!   agrees with ours.
//!   *Exact*, and it has a reference: the decoder.
//! - **Quality** — PSNR. Reported, never gated (except lossless, where it
//!   becomes exact and therefore conformance again). A *measurement*: it
//!   informs, and no particular value is required.
//! - **Control** — did the encoder achieve the objective it was handed?
//!   No ground truth exists at all. Unlike quality it is not informational:
//!   hitting the target *is* the feature. And unlike conformance, nothing
//!   in the bitstream is wrong when it fails.
//!
//! [`super::h265_sao`]'s predicted-versus-actual check was the first
//! instance of the third kind here, before it had a name. This module is
//! the second, and the sharper one: **a controller that ignores its target
//! entirely still produces a perfectly legal stream that passes SELF,
//! passes CROSS, and reports a fine PSNR.** Every check this project had
//! before today is blind to it.
//!
//! ## So what is actually checked
//!
//! Three things, at three different strengths, and the strengths are not
//! interchangeable:
//!
//! 1. **Exact — the ledger.** [`RateController::bits_spent`] must equal
//!    the bytes actually emitted, times eight. Not the *prediction* — a
//!    rate model is a heuristic and asserting it would be asserting a wish
//!    — but the *accounting*. This is what catches the silent class:
//!    forgetting start-code and NAL-header overhead, counting parameter
//!    sets once or three times, dropping the last picture from the
//!    accumulator, measuring the slice payload against an access-unit
//!    target. A ledger drifting eight percent low overshoots forever with
//!    every other check green. The encoder holds it to equality on every
//!    picture.
//! 2. **Gated, and deliberately loose — the band.** The gate asserts the
//!    achieved rate lands within [0.5x, 2.0x] of target. That is a wide
//!    band and it is wide on purpose: the corpus is six to twelve frames,
//!    which gives a controller almost no time to converge, and the opening
//!    IDR dominates a clip that short. A tighter tolerance would be flaky
//!    rather than rigorous, and a flaky row teaches people to re-run it.
//!    The tightness is bought back elsewhere: the gate's targets *bracket*
//!    each clip's natural constant-QP rate, so the controller is forced to
//!    move the quantiser in both directions and a target-ignoring
//!    controller fails the low row on every clip.
//! 3. **Ordered response — a test, not a gate row.** Encode one clip at
//!    several targets: the sizes must be strictly ordered with the targets
//!    and separated by a real margin. This is the strongest anti-vacuity
//!    property and it needs no convergence, so six frames are plenty — but
//!    it is a comparison *between* encodes, and the gate runs one cell at a
//!    time. It lives in this module's tests instead.
//!
//! The operating rule behind all three: **a rate-control check is
//! meaningful exactly when it fails for a controller that ignores its
//! target.** That is an experiment, not a judgement — replace this module's
//! output with a constant quantiser and see what goes red. Doing exactly
//! that is what caught the gate's failure tally not listing `RATE-FAIL`:
//! ten cells printed a failure and were counted as passes.
//!
//! ## What the corpus can and cannot ask for
//!
//! A target outside a clip's achievable range cannot be hit by *any*
//! controller, so the gate's targets have to sit inside every clip's range
//! at once. Measured, in bits per second, between quantiser 51 and 0:
//!
//! ```text
//!     clip                        floor      ceiling    range
//!     src_detail_64x64_420       21_900      933_930    42.6x
//!     src_motion_64x64_420       13_440      361_020    26.9x
//!     src_grad_64x64_420          5_910      107_970    18.3x
//!     src_odd_50x34_420          21_280       98_840     4.6x
//! ```
//!
//! The **common** range is only `[21_900, 98_840]` — about 4.5x — because
//! `src_odd_50x34_420` has almost no headroom. That is what caps the gate's
//! bracket at 64k/96k, and it is a property of the corpus rather than of
//! any controller: a tighter band wants a clip with more range, not better
//! code. At 32k the transient alone pushes two clips past 2.0x.
//!
//! ## The error has a shape, and it is not noise
//!
//! Across the gate's sixteen H.265 rate cells the achieved rate averages
//! about 1.17x of target, eleven of sixteen land above it, and every cell
//! is tighter at the higher target than the lower one. That is the seeded
//! first picture of each kind: on a six-to-twelve-frame clip one overspent
//! keyframe is a large share of the whole budget and there is no later to
//! recover it in, and the same absolute overspend matters less as the
//! target rises. A second pass or a lookahead is what fixes it; neither is
//! here, so the bias is reported rather than averaged away.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately not here
//!
//! - **Lookahead only where the encoder offers it.** By itself every
//!   decision here is made from the past only. The H.265 encoder can hold
//!   pictures back and hand this controller a cost per picture — see
//!   [`RateController::pick_qp_ahead`] and the *lookahead* section below —
//!   and with that the controller places bits by what is coming rather
//!   than by what came. H.264 does not drive that path yet.
//! - **Per-CTB adaptation lives beside this, not in it.** The quantiser
//!   this module chooses is picture-wide; the H.265 encoder's adaptive
//!   quantisation (`encode::aq`) redistributes it across coding tree
//!   blocks zero-mean, so the two do not steer the same number.
//! - **No guarantee of buffer conformance, only aim.** The controller
//!   knows the coded picture buffer when one is declared and caps each
//!   picture's target at [`CPB_AIM`] of what the buffer can afford, which
//!   keeps a well-behaved stream inside it. It cannot *promise* to: the
//!   size of a picture is not known until it is coded, so the cap is a
//!   target and not a limit. Promising would need the ability to re-code a
//!   picture that came out too large — panic mode — which is structurally
//!   possible now that both picture writers decide in one pass and
//!   serialise in another, and is deliberately not built until a clip
//!   exists that can demonstrate it working. `encode::hrd` is the
//!   instrument that would demonstrate it.
//! - **No bit allocation across a GOP beyond the intra/inter split below.**
//!
//! # The model, stated plainly
//!
//! One law, used everywhere: **bits halve for every six added to the
//! quantiser.** That is the quantiser's own definition — the step size
//! doubles every six QP — and at moderate rates the bit cost tracks it
//! closely enough to steer by. So for a picture of a given complexity,
//!
//! ```text
//!     bits(qp) ≈ k * 2^(-qp / 6)
//! ```
//!
//! and one observation `(qp, bits)` pins `k = bits * 2^(qp / 6)`. To ask
//! for `target` bits, invert it: `qp = 6 * log2(k / target)`.
//!
//! `k` is complexity, and it is tracked separately for intra and inter
//! pictures because they differ by an order of magnitude. Before any
//! observation exists it is seeded from the target's bits per pixel through
//! the same law, so the very first picture is a considered guess rather
//! than a fixed constant.
//!
//! Everything else is damping: the quantiser moves at most
//! [`MAX_QP_STEP`] per picture so quality does not visibly pulse, and the
//! bucket's correction is spread over [`CORRECTION_PICTURES`] rather than
//! taken out of the next picture alone.
//!
//! # Lookahead: the same law, with a cost in it
//!
//! An encoder that has measured the pictures it is holding can hand this
//! controller a **cost** per picture — the H.265 encoder's is a sum of
//! 8x8 SATDs, intra against each block's own mean and inter against the
//! previous source picture at zero motion (`encode::h265::PicCost`) — and
//! the law grows one factor:
//!
//! ```text
//!     bits(qp) ≈ k * cost * 2^(-qp / 6)
//! ```
//!
//! `k` is then **bits per unit of cost** rather than bits per picture,
//! which is a far more stable number: it is a property of how the codec
//! prices a unit of residual energy, not of the content, so one
//! observation of it transfers to the next picture whatever that picture
//! shows. Three things follow, each of them a mechanism the past-only
//! controller lacks:
//!
//! - **The share is measured, not assumed.** Without lookahead an intra
//!   picture is given [`INTRA_WEIGHT`] times an inter picture's bits, a
//!   round number. With it, each picture's share of the window's budget is
//!   its predicted bits at a common quantiser over the window's mean —
//!   `k(kind) * cost`, so a keyframe of flat content is not overpaid and a
//!   scene cut's first inter picture, whose cost is a keyframe's, is not
//!   starved. The ratio is bounded to `[1 / MAX_K_RATIO, MAX_K_RATIO]`
//!   so that a single wild picture cannot take the whole window.
//! - **The model sees the change before coding it.** `k * cost` predicts
//!   a picture's bits from its own samples, so the quantiser moves *with*
//!   the content rather than one picture after it — and the step limit,
//!   which exists to stop pulsing between similar pictures, is widened by
//!   exactly the measured cost ratio (`6 * log2(cost / last cost)`) so a
//!   measured change is not throttled as if it were noise.
//! - **A kind that has not been measured borrows from one that has.**
//!   The first P picture of a stream no longer starts from the bits-per-
//!   pixel seed: it takes the keyframe's observed `k` and its own cost.
//!   Before any observation at all the seed is [`SEED_BITS_PER_COST`],
//!   a calibration, clamped through the same [`SEED_QP_MIN`] and
//!   [`SEED_QP_MAX`] a past-only seed is. A picture planned from a seed
//!   alone that misses by far is coded again once (*The seeded first
//!   pictures* below).
//!
//! What lookahead does **not** change: the ledger, the bucket, the buffer
//! cap, and every check above. A cost of one and an empty window is the
//! past-only controller exactly, which is what [`RateController::pick_qp`]
//! passes — so a stream that does not ask for lookahead is coded by the
//! same arithmetic it always was.
//!
//! ## Fade pictures in lookahead ABR (the cap implemented, the rest measured)
//!
//! On a fade the lookahead controller ends over its target. The gate's
//! fade clip (`src_fade`, a luma gain fade) ended at 1.083x at 64 kbps,
//! 1.030x at 96 kbps and 1.109x with two B pictures at 64 kbps. The two
//! gain-and-offset fades, which no lookahead row of the gate visits, end
//! at 1.280x (`src_wpoff`, 8 bits) and 1.248x (`src_fdeep10`) at 96 kbps,
//! their P pictures at 1.15x and 1.18x of plan in total. Two mechanisms
//! were measured:
//!
//! - **The intra cap is fixed here.** It stays on a picture whose change
//!   is more than a brightness step, and it never applies under
//!   `--wpred` (`encode::h265::PicCost::inter_cost`).
//! - **The first mechanism is not.** A model fix for it was built and
//!   tried in 23 configurations, and none met the bar. This is the record
//!   of why.
//!
//! Measured 2026-09-14 on h26x 5dde3bb, whose encoder source is develop's
//! up to this change, with the model on the branch `agent/rcfix3`
//! (ed5ed4d); rechecked, and the cap measured and implemented, 2026-09-18.
//!
//! **The cost does not see what a fade's bits pay for.** The inter cost
//! is mostly the fade. An SATD over 4x4 Hadamard tiles prices a one-level
//! shift of an 8x8 block at 32 units: each tile's DC coefficient takes 16
//! levels and the tile sum is halved to 8. On the fade clip the mean moves
//! about 420 levels a picture summed over its blocks — 13.4k units, every
//! picture — against 3k to 6k for everything else the picture does. The
//! codec codes a brightness step cheaply. What costs bits is the rest, and
//! the three fades built on `testsrc2` (fade, wpoff, fdeep10) change a
//! small element on odd pictures. At a fixed quantiser those pictures cost
//! about twice the even ones, while the cost moves by an eighth:
//!
//! ```text
//!     src_fade at quantiser 20, no rate control   display 4   display 5
//!     bits                                            1408        3160   2.24x
//!     inter cost (zero-motion SATD)                  15252       17104   1.12x
//!       of which not the mean shift                   2991        5411   1.81x
//! ```
//!
//! `k` is blended half and half with the last observation, so every P
//! picture is planned from a picture of the other parity and is about
//! twice wrong, alternately each way. At 96 kbps with `--lookahead 8`
//! those two pictures code at 20 and 18 for 1480 and 4184 bits, 0.55 and
//! 1.43 of their plan, and the clip's P pictures range from 0.45 to 1.50
//! of plan. On the gain fade the misses nearly cancel (0.95x of plan over
//! all its P pictures at 96 kbps). On the gain-and-offset fades they do
//! not. The native 10-bit fade (`src_wsine10`) has no such element and
//! does not alternate.
//!
//! This was first read as skip-lag: a coarse quantiser rounding the step
//! away and the next picture coding two steps. The reconstruction rules
//! that out. No 8x8 block of any P picture of that run is identical to the
//! same block of the picture before it. The reconstructed luma mean tracks
//! the source to within 0.11 levels on every picture. And the alternation
//! is there at a fixed quantiser, with no controller to lag.
//!
//! **The intra cap changes units at the end of a fade.** An inter picture
//! was planned at `min(intra, max(inter, floor))`. The intra cost is taken
//! against each block's own mean, so it has no DC at all, while the inter
//! cost carries the whole brightness step. As a fade reaches black the
//! texture goes, the intra cost falls under the inter cost, and the plan
//! falls with it while the bits do not:
//!
//! ```text
//!     src_wpoff at 96 kbps, last GOP      display 9    10      11
//!     intra cost                              16000    11196    6000
//!     inter cost                              21665    19740   19508
//!     plan (bits)                              4206     3504    2415
//!     spent                                    5136     4176    7688   3.18x plan at display 11
//!     at quantiser 13, no rate control         4760     3488    6600
//! ```
//!
//! `src_fdeep10`'s display 11 is the same story: intra 7920 against inter
//! 21883, and 2.87x its plan. The cap matters less than the first mechanism.
//! Over every lookahead cell it binds on only 10 distinct pictures: the
//! last one to three of each fade, and the cut clip's cut, where it is
//! right. See *What is implemented* below.
//!
//! **What predicts a fade picture's bits.** For each candidate cost, the
//! spread of `log2(bits * 2^(qp / 6) / cost)` within a cell — how far one
//! `k` misses across a clip — pooled over 447 P pictures of the 28
//! lookahead cells without B pictures (the four fades against the rest).
//! "Fade bias" is the fades' mean `log2 k` less everyone else's. The
//! SATD is the encoder's own tiled kernel, reproduced offline to zero
//! mismatches against its costs. An earlier fit with a plain 8x8 Hadamard
//! gave 0.33 for the reference cost, and that number was wrong.
//!
//! ```text
//!     cost                                         fade    other   fade bias
//!     today: min(intra, max(inter, floor))        0.586    0.518     -1.902
//!     SATD against the previous source            0.447    1.078     -3.886
//!     SATD against the reconstructed reference    0.431    0.522     -1.146
//!       each block's mean difference removed      0.340    0.518     +0.121
//!       removed, then 8 per level added back      0.374    0.519     -0.361
//! ```
//!
//! The mean-removed difference against the reference is the best
//! predictor for fades and no worse for anything else. That is the first
//! mechanism in numbers: the bits follow the part of the difference that
//! is not the fade.
//!
//! **Telling a fade apart.** A picture is fade-like when its mean shift,
//! priced at the SATD's own 32 per level, is at least everything else:
//! `dc > 0 && 32 * dc >= inter_ac`. Here `inter_ac` is the inter SATD with
//! each block's mean difference removed and `dc` is the summed absolute
//! mean difference. Over the distinct inter pictures of every lookahead
//! cell:
//!
//! ```text
//!     32 * dc / inter_ac    pictures    min     p50     p90     max
//!     the four fades             40    1.341   2.630   4.493   6.548
//!     everything else           172    0.036   0.094   0.197   0.760   (20 with dc = 0)
//! ```
//!
//! A threshold of 1.0 sits between the cut clip's cut (0.760) and
//! wsine10's first P picture (1.341). Outside the corpus, at 1280x720:
//!
//! - A cinema trailer, 1525 pictures: 48 flagged in 8 runs. Each run is a
//!   real fade or grading pulse (a logo fading in, clouds fading up, a
//!   lighting pulse, a fade out).
//! - A UHD stock clip, 207 pictures: none flagged, maximum 0.366.
//! - A 1080p clip, 750 pictures: none flagged, maximum 0.137.
//!
//! The detector is the part that works.
//!
//! **What was tried.** The fix in `agent/rcfix3` used the detector:
//!
//! - A P picture it flagged, outside `--wpred`, had its quantiser inverted
//!   from a *model* cost, the SATD of its luma against the reconstructed
//!   reference it predicts from.
//! - That model cost had its own bits-per-cost estimate, while the window
//!   shares kept the source costs.
//! - A picture not flagged was untouched, and in every configuration no
//!   byte of any non-fade rate cell moved.
//!
//! The bar, for the five fade lookahead cells the gate then visited
//! (wsine10 by the 10-bit row; since a35a614 only `@wsine10` rows visit
//! it, and none of them is a lookahead row):
//!
//! - **(a)** Non-fade cells byte-identical.
//! - **(b)** Mean `|ratio - 1|` below 0.0474 over the five cells (mean5),
//!   or below 0.0585 over the four that are not wsine10 (mean4). None of
//!   those four more than 0.01 further from target.
//! - **(c)** No plane of a moved cell more than 0.30 dB under the quality
//!   floor.
//! - **(d)** No cell both larger and worse.
//!
//! Every configuration, by the names the round files use, scored against
//! that bar:

//!
//! - `model`: the committed fix.
//! - `ac`: its cost with each block's mean difference removed.
//! - `dcw=w`: `ac` plus `w` per level of mean difference.
//! - `damp=a`: the model's `k` moves `a` of the way to each observation,
//!   not half.
//! - `anchor=d`: the quantiser at most `d` above the last reference
//!   picture's.
//! - `rise=d`: at most `d` above the last fade-planned P's.
//! - `step=s`: within `s` of it. The `step=1` rows put wsine10 at 0.351x
//!   and 0.358x, out of the band.
//! - `tail`: the window's last P planned by today's cost.
//!
//! Round 2 ran `ac` again as its control, and it scored the same.
//!
//! Before the model, four families were scored on rate alone:
//!
//! - **The inter cost as `inter_ac + w * dc` for every picture**
//!   (w 0 to 16). Moved 11 to 19 of the 32 non-fade lookahead cells, 7 to
//!   10 of them further from target. A cost change for everyone is not a
//!   fade fix.
//! - **The reference cost for every P picture, ungated.** The gate's mean
//!   `|ratio - 1|` went from 0.0782 to 0.0764, but 29 non-fade cells
//!   moved and 15 of them went further.
//! - **The cap raised to `intra + w * dc`.** Moved the four cut-clip
//!   cells, whose cut is capped. It did the most for the gain-and-offset
//!   fades (1.082x and 1.084x at w = 32) and pushed wsine10 to 0.888.
//! - **The cap dropped where `inter_ac + w * dc <= intra`.** This is
//!   what is implemented (below). As first measured it applied under
//!   `--wpred` too, and there it failed (b) on one cell, the weighted
//!   la-ipb row: 0.988 to 0.975, 0.013 further from target.
//!
//! **What is implemented.** The cap is dropped on a P or B picture where
//! `inter_ac + 16 * dc <= intra`: the change, its brightness step priced
//! at half the SATD's own 32 per level, still fits under the intra cost.
//! It is never dropped under `--wpred`, where the encoder takes the step
//! out itself with the weights. Scored on all 128 rate cells against the
//! same bar and base (`D:/rivet-rcfix4/capwp/capwp.txt`), it passes:
//!
//! ```text

//! ```
//!
//! Every moved cell spends less, so every one loses a little PSNR, 0.02
//! to 0.22 dB. On the gain-and-offset fades, which no gate row visits,
//! fdeep10 goes from 1.248x to 1.229x and wpoff from 1.280x to 1.289x.
//! On wpoff the rule uncaps only display 9, which then spends 0.96 of
//! its plan instead of 1.22. Displays 10 and 11 are darker, their intra
//! cost has fallen under even `inter_ac + 16 * dc`, and they keep the
//! cap. Display 11 still spends 3.23x its plan (`latrace_b16`).
//!
//! The price was tried at 8 and 16. At 8 the same four gate cells moved
//! the same way except wsine10, which fell to 0.888: its capped end
//! pictures had been cancelling an under-spent keyframe, and a cheaper
//! price uncaps more of them.
//!
//! **Why la-ipb is the blocker.** The fade is luma only, so its chroma is
//! still. Chroma quality is set by the anchors — the IDR and P pictures —
//! and every B picture inherits it. The model moves spend inside the
//! first GOP: P 6 goes 2632 to 2376 bits, and B 5 goes 904 to 1496. The
//! IDR at display 8 then gets 3912 bits instead of 4152, and the second
//! GOP loses chroma in every variant: display 9 Cb -1.79 to -2.23. The
//! committed model also prices the last P (display 11, nearly black,
//! coded before displays 9 and 10) from its reference and raises it from
//! quantiser 24 to 29. It spends 3408 bits instead of 4608, as planned,
//! but its Cb falls from 41.19 to 36.72 dB (-4.47), display 10 loses 1.30
//! and display 6 loses 1.02. Exempting that picture (round 3) left -0.40
//! on both chroma planes, the same in all six variants. The IDR still
//! lost its bits, and the pictures after it still lost chroma (display 9
//! Cb -2.15, display 11 -2.03). A fade P picture is cheap in its own bits
//! and expensive in its dependants', and a per-picture model cannot see
//! the second part.
//!
//! **What a fix would need.**
//!
//! 1. **An anchor-aware quantiser.** An anchor's cost to the clip has to
//!    include the pictures predicted from it: a propagation of each
//!    picture's inter cost back to its references, as x264's MB-tree
//!    does. The lookahead already holds the window and the picture types
//!    to do it. Without that, anything that takes spend off a fade anchor
//!    fails la-ipb's chroma.
//! 2. **A `k` that is not fooled by alternation.** A half-and-half blend
//!    with the last picture is twice wrong on every picture of content that
//!    alternates. Planning fades from the mean-removed reference cost
//!    narrowed the swing: at la-96k, displays 5 and 6 coded at 3672 and
//!    1768 bits against the base's 4152 and 1152. It still did not beat the
//!    base ratio (1.044 against 1.030). Damping the model's `k` to 0.25 met
//!    the rate conditions and failed only the floor.
//! 3. **Gate rows where the overspend is.** The gain fade's P pictures
//!    are already near plan in total. The overspend is on wpoff and
//!    fdeep10 (1.280x, 1.248x), which no lookahead row visits. A fix
//!    should arrive with `@wpoff` and `@fdeep10` lookahead rows and a floor
//!    recorded for them.
//!
//! wsine10's 1.003 was two errors cancelling: keyframes at 0.25 and 0.24
//! of plan against capped end pictures overspending (display 11 at
//! 2.19x). Anything that fixes the end pictures moves it off 1.0 until the
//! keyframe seed is fixed. *The seeded first pictures* below fixes the
//! first keyframe and takes wsine10 to 1.101x.
//!
//! **Where the evidence is.** The measurements are on the machine they
//! were taken on, under `D:/rivet-rcfix3` and `D:/rivet-rcfix4`:
//!
//! - The alternation and the skip-lag refutation: `cqp/` (bits at a fixed
//!   quantiser) and `skiplag_fade96.out`. The zero copied blocks and the
//!   0.11-level mean came from the same reconstruction, `recon/`.
//! - The traces: `ftrace/*.log` and `latrace_ctl2/`.
//! - The fit: `refcost_recon.out`, from `refcost.py`.
//! - The detector: `detector_margin.out` and `detector_natural2.log`.
//! - The rounds: `round1.txt` to `round3.txt`, rescored in `rescore.txt`
//!   and `rescore_table.out`.
//! - The earlier families: `cmp_prerounds.out`.
//! - The cap: `capb/capb.txt` (under `--wpred`), `capwp/capwp.txt` (as
//!   implemented) and `latrace_b16/` (its per-picture trace).
//! - la-ipb: `ipb_psnr.out` and `ipb_variants_psnr.out`.
//!
//! ## The seeded first pictures, coded again when they miss
//!
//! Under lookahead the stream's first picture is planned from
//! [`SEED_BITS_PER_COST`] and nothing else. That calibration was taken
//! before the coding quadtree became the default, and it now misses:
//!
//! - **The gate's lookahead cells.** Over its 36 lookahead cells, first
//!   keyframes spent a median 0.82 of plan: 21 under 0.84, 15 under 0.71,
//!   and 2 over 1.19. The observed `k` had median 3.32 (quartiles 2.55 and
//!   4.02) against the seed's 4.2. Later keyframes, planned from a
//!   measurement, spent a median 0.97, so only the seeded pick misses.
//! - **The grad clip.** Its keyframes sat on [`SEED_QP_MIN`] at 0.11 to
//!   0.20 of plan.
//! - **A 720p natural clip** at 2 Mb/s. The seed asked for more than
//!   [`SEED_QP_MAX`], the keyframe was coded at 45 on 0.28 of plan (28.5 dB
//!   luma), and the first P spent 5.07 times its plan repairing it.
//!
//! **What is implemented** ([`RateController::seed_recode`]):
//!
//! - **The first picture.** A picture planned from a seed alone that lands
//!   more than [`SEED_RECODE_STEPS`] from its plan is coded again once, at
//!   the quantiser its own bits imply. That quantiser may be below the
//!   seed's floor, because it is a measurement, and it is bounded by
//!   [`MAX_FIRST_STEP`].
//! - **The first P after it.** When the keyframe was coded again, the
//!   first P borrows a measured `k` rather than the calibration, so the
//!   seed's clamp no longer holds it. It may be coded again once the same
//!   way.
//! - **Nothing else.** At most two extra codings per stream, and none
//!   without a lookahead.
//!
//! Scored on the 125 rate cells of develop f74b437 against its own
//! binary (`D:/rivet-rcfix4/kfclean/clean.txt`), the mean `|ratio - 1|`
//! over the 36 lookahead cells goes from 0.0795 to 0.0523:
//!
//! - **What moves.** 15 cells move, all with luma up 0.65 to 10.37 dB.
//!   12 end closer to target. The motion clip at 64 kbps goes from 1.035
//!   to 1.037, with luma up 2.71 dB. The two that end further by more than
//!   0.01 are below. No plane falls more than 0.30 dB, nothing is larger
//!   and worse, and no cell outside the lookahead rows moves.
//! - **The fade clip at 96 kbps: 1.019 to 1.077**, with luma up 2.14 dB.
//!   Its P pictures alternate as the fade section above records, now
//!   0.53 to 1.57 of plan against 0.46 to 1.47. Over the clip the P
//!   pictures spend 1.06 of their plan where they spent 0.95, because
//!   the under-spent keyframe that absorbed the misses no longer does.
//! - **The odd clip at 96 kbps: 0.904 to 0.870**, but on 2089 bytes
//!   against 2169 and with luma up 10.37 dB. It is strictly better.
//! - **The native 10-bit fade** (no gate lookahead row) goes from 0.995 to
//!   1.101: the two errors above, with the keyframe's now gone.
//! - **The 720p natural clip** codes its keyframe again at 34 (35.8 dB,
//!   0.89 of plan) and ends at 1.009x with luma up 0.51 dB. Its plan error
//!   goes from 6.02 to 5.29 steps, and its worst picture from 28.5 to 35.5
//!   dB.
//!
//!   Its first P misses the other way. At 31 it spent 1.78 times its plan;
//!   coded again at 36 it spent 0.11. Near its skip threshold a P picture's
//!   bits fall far faster than six steps per doubling, and one re-code by
//!   the law cannot see that.
//!
//! **What it costs.** Two re-codes on a 2-frame 720p stream take 0.30 s,
//! about one extra keyframe. That is 14.5% of a 12-frame stream (2.05 s),
//! 1.3% of 120 frames (23.7 s) and 0.28% of 600 frames (108.6 s): best of
//! 3 to 9 on a loaded machine. A caller that builds an encoder per segment
//! pays it per segment.
//!
//! **What was tried and not kept** (36 cells, mean 0.0803 on the base
//! then; `D:/rivet-rcfix4/kf`, `kf2`):
//!
//! ```text

//! ```
//!
//! - **The recalibrated seed** makes every first keyframe spend more. That
//!   uncovers the overspend the under-spent keyframes were hiding, all at
//!   once, and it moves detail10-444 the wrong way: that keyframe was
//!   already over its plan, and the cell goes from 1.098 to 1.117.
//! - **The unclamped first P without its own re-code** borrows an intra
//!   `k` that is 2 to 4 times too low for a P at a low quantiser. It spent
//!   3.35 to 4.45 times its plan on the odd and static clips.
//! - **The secant re-code** lands keyframes near plan: 0.84 to 1.04, and
//!   grad 0.42 to 0.73 at the step bound. A single re-code by the law
//!   lands short (0.29 to 0.82), because six steps per doubling is too
//!   steep below about 30. But landing on plan only makes the clips
//!   overshoot more.
