//! Deblocking the encoder's reconstruction — with the decoder's filter.
//!
//! The slice headers this encoder writes used to disable the loop filter,
//! because the encoder did not run one and SELF demands that the encoder's
//! reconstruction equal what a decoder produces byte for byte. This module
//! buys the filter back the only way that property survives: by running
//! the *decoder's* `deblock_mb_rows` (src/h264/deblock.rs; conformance-
//! proven, clause 8.7) over the encoder's own reconstruction, fed the
//! same per-macroblock state a decoder derives while parsing.
//!
//! That state is the whole game. The filter's boundary strengths read the
//! macroblock kind (intra edges are bS 3/4 unconditionally), the
//! nonzero-coefficient mask (bS 2), and the motion field (bS 1/0), plus
//! each macroblock's QPs for the thresholds — and it reads all of it out
//! of the decoder's own `PicInfo` and per-4x4 motion, which the picture
//! walks now fill as they code ([`PicMotion`]). Nothing is synthesised
//! here any more: there is no encoder-side summary of a macroblock left to
//! be subtly different from what a decoder derived.
//!
//! Ordering mirrors the decoder's: it filters a row only after the row
//! below is reconstructed (intra prediction reads unfiltered neighbours)
//! and extends borders after filtering. The encoder has the simpler shape
//! of the same discipline — reconstruct the whole picture, then filter it
//! whole, then crop and store — one `deblock_mb_rows` call over every
//! row, after the last macroblock and before the reconstruction becomes a
//! reference.
//!
//! The picture is wrapped in a decoder `Frame` by *moving* the planes in
//! and out (`Vec` swaps, no copies); the per-picture `PicInfo` and motion
//! allocations are small beside the planes and can join a pool the day a
//! profile says so.
