//! Sample adaptive offset decision for H.265 — choosing the offsets, then
//! applying the decoder's own filter.
//!
//! The third and last member of the loop-filter family here, and built the
//! way the second one was: `hevc::sao::sao_ctb_row` is the decoder's
//! filter, conformance-proven, and this module does not reimplement it.
//! What the encoder contributes is the *parameters* — per CTB, per
//! component, which of the two offset kinds to apply and with what values
//! — and the state the filter reads them out of.
//!
//! # Where it sits, and why the order is not negotiable
//!
//! SAO runs **after deblocking**, on the deblocked samples, and its output
//! is what the picture becomes: what a decoder emits, what SELF compares
//! against, and what the next picture predicts from. So the encoder's
//! sequence per picture is reconstruct, deblock, decide SAO, apply SAO —
//! and only then may the reconstruction be cropped or kept as a reference.
//!
//! One consequence shapes this whole module: the parameters cannot be
//! serialised as each CTU is coded, because they are not known until the
//! whole picture has been reconstructed *and* deblocked, and the reader
//! takes them at the **start** of each CTU, ahead of its coding quadtree.
//! The picture writer therefore decides in one pass and serialises in
//! another. That costs nothing — the decisions never depended on the
//! bitstream — but it is why `code_picture` looks the way it does.
//!
//! # The classification is the reader's, read off the filter
//!
//! Nothing here re-derives what a category means; the two classifiers are
//! mirrored line for line from `hevc::sao::sao_ctb`, which is the code
//! that will apply them:
//!
//! - **Band** (`type_idx` 1): a sample's band is `v >> (bit_depth - 5)`,
//!   0..=31, and only the four consecutive bands starting at
//!   `sao_band_position` carry an offset (`table[(k + pos) & 31]`), so the
//!   window wraps.
//! - **Edge** (`type_idx` 2): `edgeIdx = 2 + sign(v - a) + sign(v - b)`
//!   over the two neighbours the class picks, and `off_tab = [o0, o1, 0,
//!   o2, o3]` — category 2 is "no change" and has no offset at all. That
//!   is also why offsets 0 and 1 are positive and 2 and 3 negative: they
//!   apply to local minima and valleys, and to ridges and local maxima,
//!   and the syntax codes no sign for them.
//!
//! A sample whose classifying neighbours are not usable is **left
//! untouched** by the filter, so the statistics must skip it too, or the
//! offsets are computed from samples that will never receive them. In the
//! one-slice, one-tile pictures this encoder writes, "not usable" reduces
//! to "outside the picture" — but it is written as the filter's own
//! question rather than as that shortcut.
//!
//! # What is decided, and how
//!
//! Per CTB and component: the sum of squared error against the source, for
//! leaving it alone and for every candidate — 32 band positions and four
//! edge classes. Within a candidate each category's best offset is the
//! rounded mean of `src - rec` over its samples, clamped to the syntax's
//! range (cMax, and to the sign the syntax forces in edge mode). The
//! change in SSD from applying offset `o` to a category is then
//! `count * o^2 - 2 * o * sum` for the samples the offset moves in full,
//! and a smaller, fixed amount for each one the filter's clip stops at a
//! rail (see [`Cat`]) — exactly, so no filtering is needed to score a
//! candidate.
//!
//! The winner is the smallest `distortion + lambda * bins`, with `lambda`
//! and the bin counts the same placeholder policy the other decision
//! modules use — one function, replaced wholesale when a real bit count
//! exists. Then each CTB is offered its left and upper neighbour's
//! parameters, and merges when they cost less overall: a merge is two bins
//! against forty or so, so it wins often on flat content and is not a
//! rarely-taken path.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Lossless is refused by name upstream rather than handled: every CU of a
//! lossless picture is transquant-bypass, every bypass sample is exempt
//! from both loop filters, and SAO would therefore be a no-op declared in
//! every slice header. Shipping that is worse than refusing it.
