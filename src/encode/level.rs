//! The level a stream claims, derived from what the stream is.
//!
//! A level is a promise about a whole stream: this many samples per
//! picture, this many per second, a decoded picture buffer no larger than
//! this, a coded picture buffer and bit rate within these bounds. A
//! decoder sizes itself from it before it has decoded a picture — the
//! H.264 decoder in this crate takes its DPB size from `level_idc` alone
//! when the SPS says nothing more (`h264::sps::Sps::level_max_dpb_frames`),
//! and so does libavcodec — and a player negotiates capability with it. So
//! both directions of error cost something. Claiming too little is a
//! conformance violation a decoder is entitled to act on; claiming too
//! much makes a hardware decoder that could play the stream refuse it.
//! These encoders used to write constants: H.264 level 5.1, which
//! over-claimed every stream below 4K, and H.265 level 4.0, which
//! under-claimed every stream above 1080p.
//!
//! What this derives instead is the **lowest** level whose limits admit
//! everything the encoder knows about the stream before writing a byte of
//! it. The limits are the standards' own (H.264 Annex A, clauses A.3.1 to
//! A.3.3, Tables A-1, A-2 and A-4; H.265 Annex A, clauses A.4.1 and A.4.2,
//! Tables A.8 to A.10), and each check below names the item it is.
//!
//! # What the derivation reads
//!
//! - **Picture size**: the coded size, the one the SPS declares. For H.264
//!   that is whole macroblocks (`MaxFS`, and each dimension within
//!   `Sqrt(MaxFS * 8)`). For H.265 it is `PicSizeInSamplesY` (`MaxLumaPs`,
//!   the same square-root rule).
//! - **Picture rate**, `Config::fps / Config::fps_den` exactly — 29.97 is
//!   30000/1001, not 30: macroblocks (H.264 `MaxMBPS`) or luma samples
//!   (H.265 `MaxLumaSr`) per second, and the absolute ceiling `fR` puts on
//!   pictures per second — 172 below H.264 level 6, 300 at 6 and above and
//!   throughout H.265.
//! - **The decoded picture buffer the stream needs.** H.264: the
//!   `max_num_ref_frames` the SPS writes. The B pictures are not
//!   references, and the output-order DPB (C.4.5.2) outputs one directly
//!   when it has the lowest picture order count waiting, so references
//!   alone are enough, and `MaxDpbFrames` must hold that many. A stream
//!   with a declared buffer also carries `dpb_output_delay`, and output *at
//!   those times* keeps each B picture `bframes - 1` frame intervals after
//!   it is decoded, so the timed DPB peaks at `refs + bframes - 1`. H.265:
//!   the `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1 + 1` the SPS writes, against
//!   `MaxDpbSize` (Equation A-2).
//! - **The rate**, where one is known: the declared buffer's `BitRate` and
//!   `CpbSize` when there is one, otherwise the average-rate target. Both
//!   are held to the *VCL* factor (`cpbBrVclFactor`, `CpbVclFactor` and
//!   `BrVclFactor`), the stricter of the two. The stream declares only a
//!   NAL HRD, so the VCL HRD is the one the standard *infers* at the VCL
//!   factor (H.264 E.2.2, H.265 E.3.3), and the stream has to conform to
//!   that one too.
//! - **Lossless**: the stream is as large as its samples. H.264 codes
//!   every lossless macroblock as I_PCM, so the size is exact: raw samples
//!   plus the `mb_type` and alignment around them. For H.265's
//!   transquant-bypass it is the rate of content that does not compress.
//!   So a lossless stream is held to the raw rate, to a buffer that holds
//!   one raw picture, and to the per-picture size bound `MinCR` sets
//!   (8-bit H.264 High only — A.3.3 notes 3 and 4 exempt the deeper
//!   profiles) or `MinCr` sets (every H.265 profile).
//! - **A constant quantiser gets no rate term.** The only worst case that
//!   could be justified at a fixed QP is the raw rate, and it would label a
//!   1080p30 CQP stream H.264 level 6.2. So CQP streams are labelled by
//!   what the encoder controls — size, picture rate, DPB — which is also
//!   how x264 and x265 label a stream with no VBV. Whether a CQP stream's
//!   bit rate then fits the level is the caller's choice of quantiser.
//!
//! Structural limits apply as well:
//!
//! - H.264 levels 1 to 2 and 4.2 and above require `frame_mbs_only_flag`,
//!   so an interlaced stream lives in 2.1..=4.1.
//! - H.264 A.3.3(k): below level 6, a High 10, 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 picture of
//!   more than 1620 macroblocks may put at most `MaxFS / 4` of them in one
//!   slice. This encoder codes one slice per picture, so that sets the
//!   level floor for such pictures.
//! - H.265 levels 5 and above require a 32 or 64 coding tree block.
//! - H.265 references per picture (`NumPicTotalCurr`) are at most 8 at
//!   every level.
//!
//! # Tier
//!
//! H.265 levels 4 and up have a High tier, with larger rate and buffer
//! limits and nothing else. A decoder built for the Main tier refuses a
//! High-tier stream at any level, and many consumer decoders are exactly
//! that. So the derivation takes the lowest Main-tier level that admits
//! the stream. It goes to the High tier only when no Main-tier level up to
//! 6.2 carries the rate, and then takes the lowest High-tier level that
//! does.
//!
//! # Beyond the last level
//!
//! Both tables end at 6.2. (H.265 V9 adds 6.3 and 7.x, which few decoders
//! know; they are deliberately not offered.) A stream beyond 6.2:
//!
//! - **H.264**: refused by name, before a byte is written, with the limits
//!   it exceeds. H.264 has no label for such a stream, and writing 6.2
//!   would be the false claim this module exists to stop.
//! - **H.265**: written as **level 8.5** (`general_level_idc` 255, High
//!   tier), which is the standard's own label for a stream beyond every
//!   level (A.4.1: "a suitable label for bitstreams that can exceed the
//!   limits of all other specified levels"). It is not refused.
//!
//! # What the encoder keeps for its level
//!
//! Some limits constrain the encoder's *decisions*, not its parameters,
//! and no choice of level can meet them on its behalf. The encoder derives
//! the level first and then holds its decisions to it
//! ([`MotionLimits`]):
//!
//! - H.264 `MaxVmvR` (A.3.2(g)): every luma vector's vertical component
//!   within `[-MaxVmvR, MaxVmvR - 1/4]` frame samples — 64 at level 1, 512
//!   from 3.1 — halved in a field macroblock's own rows. The motion search
//!   clamps its window to it, as x264 does (`h264_me::search_rect`).
//! - H.264 `MaxMvsPer2Mb` (A.3.2(i)): at most 32 motion vectors in any
//!   two consecutive macroblocks at level 3, 16 from 3.1 — consecutive in
//!   decoding order, across slices and pictures. Each 8x8 quarter of a
//!   macroblock is held to an eighth of that, so no macroblock takes more
//!   than half and no pair more than all, whatever its neighbours hold:
//!   level 3 loses the bi-predicted 4x4 sub-macroblock, 3.1 every 4x4 and
//!   every bi-predicted sub-macroblock below 8x8. Only `--subparts` offers
//!   those shapes; everything else spends at most eight vectors.
//! - H.264 `MinLumaBiPredSize` 8x8 (A.3.3(e), Table A-4, from 3.1): no
//!   `B_Bi_8x4`, `B_Bi_4x8` or `B_Bi_4x4`, which the budget above already
//!   excludes and the search refuses by name as well.
//!
//! # What is not checked here
//!
//! - **The rate of a constant-quantiser stream.** See above: no bound
//!   below the raw rate can be justified, so it is left to the caller's
//!   quantiser, as x264 and x265 leave it without a VBV.
//! - **The per-picture `MinCR` / `MinCr` bound** for anything but
//!   lossless. At a declared buffer each picture is held to the buffer
//!   instead, which `h26xhrd` checks.
//! - **The buffer against the level.** `h26xhrd` (examples/) walks the
//!   coded picture buffer the stream *declares* and nothing else. It does
//!   not compare that buffer with the level's `MaxBR` / `MaxCPB`. The
//!   derivation here keeps the declared `BitRate` and `CpbSize` within
//!   the VCL factor times those limits by construction, so a stream that
//!   passes `h26xhrd` also meets its level's rate limits.
