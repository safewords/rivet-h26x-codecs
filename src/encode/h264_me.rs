//! Motion estimation and inter mode decision for H.264 P macroblocks.
//!
//! This is the inter counterpart of [`super::h264_intra`]: the *deciding*
//! half of coding a P macroblock — which vector, whether the macroblock
//! skips, what the quantised coefficients are, and what the reconstruction
//! looks like. Turning that into bits belongs to the entropy coders, and
//! the seam is [`InterDecision`] — data, not a shared file, shaped after
//! [`super::h264_intra::MbDecision`] so the serialisers meet a familiar
//! layout.
//!
//! The same two rules shape everything here:
//!
//! **The prediction is the decoder's own.** The chosen vector's prediction
//! runs through the decoder's [`crate::dsp::h264::H264Dsp`] quarter-sample
//! and chroma kernels, addressed exactly as `predict_partition` in
//! `src/h264/inter.rs` addresses them, reading the *reconstructed*
//! reference plane. An encoder
//! that predicted from source samples, or interpolated even one rounding
//! differently, would desync — and the desync would surface as SELF
//! failures hundreds of blocks from the cause, because inter prediction
//! compounds picture over picture where intra drift stays inside one.
//!
//! **So is the reconstruction.** The quantised residual goes back through
//! the decoder's dequantisation and inverse transform
//! ([`crate::dsp::h264::H264Dsp::residual4`]) to build the reconstruction
//! the next macroblock — and the next picture — predicts from.
//!
//! # The search, named
//!
//! Full-sample: a greedy small-diamond descent on SAD, seeded at the median
//! predictor (and at the zero vector when it lies in range), confined to
//! ±16 full samples around the seed and to the window the decoder can
//! legally read (picture plus replicated border). Then two SATD refinement
//! rings: the eight half-sample neighbours, then the eight quarter-sample
//! neighbours of the half-sample winner. 16x16 partitions only, one
//! reference (list 0, `ref_idx` 0), progressive frames only.
//!
//! Its limits are the classic ones: a greedy diamond finds the basin it is
//! seeded in, so untextured or periodic content can stall it at a local
//! minimum; there is no rate term on the vector (SAD/SATD only — the mvd
//! bit cost belongs to a rate-distortion pass that does not exist yet); and
//! one partition size cannot follow motion boundaries inside a macroblock.
//!
//! # Search cost at this scope (arithmetic, not measurement)
//!
//! Per macroblock, worst case: 2 seed SADs, then each diamond round scores
//! at most 4 new positions and must strictly improve to continue — the walk
//! is confined to a ±16 box, so at most 32 improving rounds plus the final
//! non-improving one: `2 + 4 * 33 = 134` 16x16 SADs. A macroblock whose
//! seed is already best costs `2 + 4 = 6`. Refinement always costs
//! `1 + 8 + 8 = 17` 16x16 SATDs, each behind one quarter-sample
//! interpolation. Chroma is not scored during the search (luma-only ME);
//! it is interpolated once, for the chosen vector.
//!
//! # Window legality
//!
//! A full-sample position `f` is searchable when the six-tap window of
//! every refinement reachable from it — `(21 + 21)`-sized at
//! `floor(mv / 4) - 2`, where refinement can lower the floor by one — stays
//! inside the padded plane the decoder reads without clamping. With the
//! decoder's own borders (`LUMA_PAD` = 32, `CHROMA_PAD` = 16, both in
//! `src/h264/frame.rs`) and this module's ±16 range, the chroma window is
//! then inside its border by construction. The
//! prediction helpers still carry the decoder's clamp fallback (mirroring
//! `interp` in `src/h264/inter.rs`), so a vector outside the border is
//! wrong nowhere — merely slower.
