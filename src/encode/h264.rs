//! The H.264 encoder.
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::h264::H264Decoder`]: pictures in, access units out. The
//! reconstruction loop is a decoder — it runs the same conformance-proven
//! inverse transform, prediction and deblocking the decoder does — which is
//! what makes the SELF property in `tools/verify_encode.sh` achievable rather
//! than aspirational, and it is why this module reaches into `crate::h264`
//! rather than reimplementing anything it can borrow.
//!
//! # State of it
//!
//! Configuration, picture typing and coding order, the access-unit envelope,
//! and real compression on every picture type through both entropy coders:
//! intra, P and B pictures go through prediction, transform, quantisation
//! and the loop filter, decided once in the shared walks of
//! [`super::h264_pic`] and spelled by the CAVLC
//! ([`super::h264_cavlc_mb`]) or CABAC ([`super::h264_cabac_mb`]) writers.
//! What still codes as `I_PCM` does so for a stated reason: lossless,
//! because PCM *is* the exact mode and the transform path is lossy — and
//! the inter pictures of a lossless stream are all-skip, because a
//! lossless inter picture has no exact spelling but PCM either.
//!
//! # Sample depth
//!
//! Eight to fourteen bits, the decoder's own range. [`H264Encoder`] is a
//! thin face over a private `Core<S>` instantiated at the sample width the
//! depth needs — `u8` at 8 bits, `u16` above — exactly the split
//! [`super::h265::H265Encoder`] makes and the decoder makes on reading the
//! SPS. Everything below the face is generic: the decision walks, the
//! predictors and kernels (`H264Dsp<S>`, the decoder's), the writers. What
//! the depth changes is spelled in one place each — `QP'` for the scaling
//! tables ([`super::h264_intra::IntraCtx::qp_prime`]), the PCM sample
//! width, the SPS depth fields and profile, and the loop filter's
//! thresholds (which `deblock_mb_rows` scales itself from the frame's
//! depth) — and an 8-bit stream is byte for byte what it was before any
//! of it existed. What the depth deliberately does *not* change is the
//! mode-decision multiplier: `satd_lambda` in [`super::h264_intra`]
//! records the measurement that decided it.
