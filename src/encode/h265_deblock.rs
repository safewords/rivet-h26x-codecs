//! Encoder-side deblocking for H.265 — the decoder's own filter, driven
//! over the encoder's reconstruction.
//!
//! `write_pps` once set `pps_deblocking_filter_disabled_flag` purely
//! because the encoder did not filter what it reconstructs: a decoder
//! filters *its* reconstruction, so an unfiltered encoder-held picture
//! would fail SELF on every coded edge while CROSS stayed green — the
//! decoders outvoting the encoder two to nothing, as the first H.265
//! stream demonstrated. Declaring the filter off made the streams honest
//! at a real quality cost. This module buys that back the way everything
//! here is built: the filter is `hevc::deblock::deblock_rows`,
//! the decoder's own, conformance-proven; what the encoder contributes is
//! the *state* the filter reads, derived from its [`CuDecision`]s by
//! mirroring exactly the bookkeeping the decoder's `transform_unit` and
//! `coding_unit` perform — TB edge flags, per-4x4 cbf, QP, intra flags,
//! transquant-bypass exemption.
//!
//! Both entry points are wired now — [`deblock_picture`] for intra
//! pictures, [`deblock_inter_picture`] for P ones — so the flag is on for
//! every stream this encoder emits.
//!
//! **Order matters and is the caller's contract**: intra prediction reads
//! the *unfiltered* reconstruction, so [`deblock_picture`] must run after
//! every CTU of the picture has been coded, and the filtered planes are
//! then what a decoder outputs — the reconstruction SELF compares
//! against. Filtering earlier would desync every prediction that reads a
//! filtered neighbour.
//!
//! What the state derivation is worth testing is spelled by the boundary
//! strengths (8.7.2.4, `boundary_strengths` in the decoder). In an
//! all-intra picture every flagged edge has bS 2 — the intra case
//! short-circuits *before* `cbf_luma` or motion is consulted — so the
//! live inputs of [`deblock_picture`] are the edge flags, the intra
//! pred_mode, the QP and the bypass exemption, and no all-intra test can
//! catch dropping the cbf mirror. P pictures changed that:
//! [`deblock_inter_picture`]'s edges live on the full ladder — bS 2
//! against an intra neighbour, bS 1 where a flagged edge has coded
//! residual on either side *or* the motion differs by a quarter-sample
//! vector of four or more (or by reference), bS 0 where none of it does
//! — so the cbf fill and the walk-maintained motion grid both carry
//! weight there, and each has a test that its removal fails.
//!
//! **SAO stays off**, and stays named: it is the other in-loop filter, a
//! separate lever with its own SPS flag (`write_sps` keeps it 0), its own
//! parameter search and its own wiring day. Nothing in this module
//! prepares or precludes it.
