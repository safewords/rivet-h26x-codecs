//! Writing H.264 headers and the macroblock layer.
//!
//! The first thing built here is the simplest bitstream that is legal and
//! decodable: every macroblock coded as `I_PCM`, which carries its samples
//! raw. There is no prediction, no transform, no quantisation and no residual
//! coding in it, so nothing about picture quality is being decided yet — and
//! that is the point. It exercises the whole envelope in one step: sequence
//! and picture parameter sets, the slice header, the macroblock layer, the
//! CAVLC and CABAC paths through `mb_type`, NAL framing and
//! emulation prevention.
//!
//! It is also *exactly* lossless by construction, which means the gate's
//! strictest property — reconstruction equal to the source, byte for byte —
//! applies to it immediately. An encoder whose first output is exact removes
//! every quality question from the first round of debugging, leaving only the
//! question of whether the bitstream is well-formed. Everything after this is
//! a quality improvement on an envelope that is already proven against
//! the reference decoder.
