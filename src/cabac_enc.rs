//! The CABAC arithmetic *encoder* (H.264 clause 9.3.4, H.265 clause 9.3.4) —
//! the inverse of [`crate::cabac::Cabac`].
//!
//! # Sharing with the decoder
//!
//! The probability model is not duplicated here. `rangeTabLps` and the two
//! transition tables live in [`crate::cabac`] and this module reads them, so
//! there is exactly one copy of those numbers in the crate and no way for the
//! two directions to drift apart.
//!
//! What it does *not* borrow is the decoder's fused `LPS` table, indexed
//! `(range & 0xc0) | pStateIdx`. That table caches, alongside each LPS range,
//! the range *already renormalised* and the shift that renormalised it —
//! which is what lets the decoder pick a branchless arm. The encoder cannot
//! use either field, because its renormalisation is not a shift: it emits a
//! bit per doubling, and which bit depends on `low` at that moment. So it
//! reads `LPS_RANGE` — the spec table the decoder's cache is itself derived
//! from. One source, two shapes, no second copy of the data.
//!
//! # Register model
//!
//! The standard's own: a 9-bit `range` and a `low` that the spec's `PutBit`
//! keeps inside ten bits by subtracting 512 or 256 as it emits. Carries are
//! handled the standard's way too, with an outstanding-bits counter rather
//! than by propagating into already-written bytes: a run of undecided bits is
//! counted, and settled by the first bit that resolves them.
//!
//! # The state must match the decoder's, bit for bit
//!
//! Both sides choose `ctxIdxInc` from *reconstructed* neighbours, so both
//! sides must hold the same context byte at the same bin. This module updates
//! state with the same tables and the same rule as
//! [`crate::cabac::Cabac::decision`], and the round-trip test checks the
//! whole context array afterwards rather than only the bins. A divergence
//! here does not produce a wrong pixel; it produces a decoder that is reading
//! a different bin than the one written, and it surfaces hundreds of
//! macroblocks later as a stream that falls apart with no obvious cause.
//!
//! Nothing in the crate calls this yet — the encoder that will is being built
//! alongside it — so the module allows dead code. Drop the allow when the
//! first slice writer lands.
